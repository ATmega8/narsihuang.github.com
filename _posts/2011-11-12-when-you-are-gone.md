<i>I always needed time on my own.</i>

忆往日，歆羡闲云，

<i>I never thought I'd need you there when I cry.</i>

美景佳期竟不识。

<i>And the days feel like years when I'm alone.</i>

叹如今，花落数年，

<i>And the bed where you lie is made up on your side.</i>

山犹有木木无枝。

<i>When you walk away,I count the steps that you take.</i>

已别沧海，山云纵相似。

<i>Do you see how much I need you right now?</i>

遥寄锦书，安知雁回时？

<i>When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.</i>

与君别，寤寐尽相思；

<i>When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.</i>

与君别，但念君容饰；

<i>When you're gone,the words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK.</i>

与君别，曼语萦耳伴终日，

<i>I miss you.</i>

却无言，唯相思。
	
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

不曾记，此间仓皇，

<i>Everything that I do reminds me of you.</i>

沅芷澧兰曾相识。

<i>And the clothes you left,they lie on the floor.</i>

犹可见，玉簪青衫，

<i>And they smell just like you,I love the things that you do.</i>

彤管炜美缘君施。

<i>When you walk away,I count the steps that you take.</i>

已别沧海，山云纵相似。

<i>Do you see how much I need you right now?</i>

遥寄锦书，安知雁回时？

<i>When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.</i>

与君别，寤寐尽相思；

<i>When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.</i>

与君别，但念君容饰；

<i>When you're gone,the words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK.</i>

与君别，曼语萦耳伴终日，

<i>I miss you.</i>

却无言，唯相思。
    
<i>We were made for each other,out here forever.</i>

我本与君知，长命无绝衰。

<i>I know we were,yeah!</i>

是然，定然！

<i>All I ever wanted was for you to know,everything I do, I'd give my heart and soul.</i>

我欲与君知，诸事已尽心。

<i>I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me, yeah!</i>

仍悲，仍哀！

<i>When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.</i>

与君别，寤寐尽相思；

<i>When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.</i>

与君别，但念君容饰；

<i>When you're gone,the words I need to hear to always get me through the day and make it OK.</i>

与君别，曼语萦耳伴终日，

<i>I miss you.</i>

却无言，唯相思。
